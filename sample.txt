angular
-----------
Angular is a development platform for building a single page application for mobile and desktop.

Angular is a javascript framework and written using typescript.

it uses typescript & HTML to build applications

It comes with features like components, directives, forms, pipes, services,
dependency injection etc.

Angular Versions
--------------------
Early Version of angular was named as Angular2 later it was renamed to Angular.

Angular developed and maintained by Google. It has a large community due to which
can find help on web easily.

Features of Angular
-------------------
1. Two-Way DataBinding - Changes made in the view (webpage) is automatically 
updated in the component class and vice versa.

2. Powerful routing support -  Angular Powerful routing engine loads the page 
asynchronously on the same page (index.html) enabling us to create a single page application.

3. Expressive HTML - Angular enables us to use programming constructus like
if conditions, for loop etc ...to render how the html pages looks and work.

4. Modular by Design - Angular follows moduler design. We can create angular 
modules to better organize and manage our codebase.

The Component
--------------
app.component.ts is the Component that is added to the project by the angular cli

It consists of three main parts
---------------------------------
1. Import Statement
2. Class Decorator
3. Class

-> How to generate component?
Ans :  ng generate component componentname
->How to create model?
Ans : ng generate class models/movie --type=model

Import Statement
---------------------
Import Statement is used to import the libraries that are used in our component class.

Class Decorator:
------------------
Our component is decorated with @Component decorator which is part of the @Angular/core modules

Class

Types of directives
----------------------
1. Structural directives
2. Attribute directives

1.Structural directives

2. Attribute directives
---------------------------
ngModel
ngClass
ngStyle

Forms:
------------
Which collect data from the Users is called Forms.

Angular:
-----------
In Angular there are two types of forms
Template Driven Forms
Reactive Forms

Template Driven Forms:
-------------------------
1. The form is setup using ngForm directives
2. User input controls are set up using ngModel
3. ngModel provides two-way data binding

Advantages:
------------
1. Contains little code in component class
2. Easier to setup


Disadvantages
---------------
1. Difficult to add controls dynamically.
2. Unit testing is challenges
